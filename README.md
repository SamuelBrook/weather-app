# weather-app

Small weather app which has helped me learn how to use APIs and async functions.

Instruction: 

-> Type of the name of a city into the search bar and press search. 
-> The display will show a description of the weather conditions at that location along with an icon representing the main weather condition. 
-> It will also show the current temperature along with the maximum and minimum temperatures for that day.
